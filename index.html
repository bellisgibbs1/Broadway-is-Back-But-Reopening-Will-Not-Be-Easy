<p> When Broadway shut down in early March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only 20% of shows profited off their investment, according to CNBC, while other shows were on the verge of reopening.   </p>

<p> Broadway lost revenue due to the pandemic, but Off-Broadway profits will take a harder hit because fewer people are likely to go back to see an Off-Broadway performance. </p>

 <p> According to Playbill, Broadway goers like Steve Bisgoy are essential to New York City; they generated $1.83 billion from 2018-2019. 96, 900 individuals’ jobs depend on theatergoers to pay their bills. Many people who work on Broadway lost their health insurance and had to depend on unemployment checks to pay their bills or take another job during the pandemic.  Restaurants, hotels, vendors, and even the MTA depend on the billions of dollars that consumers spend on Broadway to survive. </p>

<p> Natalia Huerta, a 28-year-old business executive now actress from Texas visiting New York to attend a two-week workshop at The American Academy of Dramatic Arts, is extending her trip to see Anaïs Mitchell's Hadestown reopening this Friday night.</p>

<p> She says, "New York is Broadway," and "it is the only reason why I come to New York." </p>

<p> Lai Mon Ma, who works at a brochure stand outside of Bryant Park with 34th St Partnership, says that the company removed the brochures informing people about Broadway shows, drastically hurting her business.
According to Lai, the lack of brochures on Broadway shows has slowed down business because many of the brochures people wanted were about Broadway and tourist attractions. The Broadway League found that the Broadway audience in 2019 is 65% tourists. </p>
